## Introduction

Concurrency is a crucial aspect of writing efficient and scalable programs. In Go, concurrency is achieved through goroutines and channels. This repository provides hands-on examples to solidify your understanding of these concepts.

## Goroutines

Goroutines are lightweight threads managed by the Go runtime. They make it easy to write concurrent code. Here's a simple example:

```go 
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"time"
)

func main() {
	go sayHello()
	time.Sleep(1 * time.Second)
}

func sayHello() {
	fmt.Println("Hello, Go Concurrency!")
}
